_Last Updated: August 1, 2025_

Thank you for using **School eNurse Pass** ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the App, which is available via the Google Workspace Marketplace.

## 1. No Data Collection

I do **not** collect, store, or share any personal data from users of the App. The App operates entirely within your Google Workspace environment and does not transmit any data to external servers.

---

## 2. Google API Access

The App may request access to certain Google Workspace services (such as Gmail, Calendar, Drive, or Sheets) solely to provide its intended functionality. This access is strictly limited to real-time processing within your browser or Google account context and no data is retained.

---

## 3. No Third-Party Sharing

Because the App does not collect or store any data, there is no data to sell, share, or disclose to any third parties.

---

## 4. Security

Although the App does not store any user data, I take the security of your Google Workspace environment seriously. The App follows Googleâ€™s best practices for OAuth scopes and permissions.

---

## 5. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. If significant changes are made, the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page will be revised. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated policy.

By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.
